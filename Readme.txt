Hi, I'm S.Allwin Zola, here's my task that involves Cuisine management that basically does the following:


*Project Structure:

src/
|── components/
|   ├── Cuisines/
|         ├──Cuisines.js
|	  ├──Cuisines.css
|   ├── Categories/
|	  ├──Categories.js
|	  ├──Categories.css
|   ├── Subcategories/
|	  ├──Subcategories.js
|	  ├──Subcategories.css
|──datafile.json
|── App.js
|── index.js


* There are 3 Components:

1. Cuisines: Makes the user select the type of Cuisine they prefer and give a name to it.

2. Category: The user gets to choose a category from the dropdown as in which category they prefer their cuisine with.

3. Sub-Category: Each Category has its own sub-category associated with its own variety based on the category the user have already chose.

* A separate 'datafile.json' file is being created to store the data collectively in array-object structure and is later being imported and used in the dropdown section in Categories.js component, enabling the user to select from the listed options of Cuisines, Categories and Subcategories.

* Libraries used:

1. React Bootstrap
2. React Router-Dom
3. React useState,useEffect,useNavigate

How to run:

step 1: after extracting the folder, locate it in your space.
step 2: open cmd in the same location i.e., in the address bar and type: 'code .' , this will open the entire directory of the task in vs code.
step 3: open terminal in vs code, and type 'npm start', this will open the project in your default browser.

Thank You,
